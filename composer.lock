It aims at ONE thing, being a simple lightweight TEMPLATING system. The focus is on ONE thing - PHP can do everything, so do everything with PHP, just use SavantPHP for only separating the 'view/templating' concern from your business logic. Hence the philosophy of 'I just want to separate my front layer(view) from the back layer(code logic) in the most simple & effective way & that's it, nothing more, nothing less, nothing else (no added crap)'",
